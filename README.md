## **Assignment Questions**

1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
A DBMS consists of the following components:

    Database Engine: Handles data storage, retrieval, and update. It processes queries and ensures the database operates efficiently.
    Database Schema: Defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.
    Query Processor: Interprets and executes SQL commands, optimizing query performance.
    Transaction Management: Ensures that database operations follow the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
    Storage Manager: Manages data storage on physical media and ensures data integrity and access speed.
    User Interface: Provides tools (such as GUI or CLI) for users to interact with the database.
    Metadata: Stores information about the database structure, data types, and relationships.




2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute.

Examples:

    MySQL
    PostgreSQL
    Microsoft SQL Server
    Oracle Database




3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
DL (Data Definition Language): Used to define the structure of a database.

    Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP

DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to manipulate data in the database.

    Examples: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DCL (Data Control Language): Used to control access to the database.

    Examples: GRANT, REVOKE




4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
Primary Key	Uniquely identifies each record in a table while  a Foreign Key	Establishes a relationship between two tables.



5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities in a database and their relationships. It is used in database design to illustrate how data is structured and connected.

Key Components:

    Entities: Represented by rectangles, they are objects or concepts.
    Attributes: Represented by ovals, they describe properties of entities.
    Relationships: Represented by diamonds, they define associations between entities.


6. What are the advantages of relational databases?
    Data Integrity: Enforces consistency and accuracy of data through constraints.
    Flexibility: Supports complex queries using SQL.
    Scalability: Can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
    Data Security: Offers robust access control mechanisms.
    Data Redundancy Minimization: Reduces duplication using normalization.



7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
    INTEGER: Stores whole numbers.
    VARCHAR: Stores variable-length text.
    DATE: Stores date values.
    BOOLEAN: Stores true or false values.
   
8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?  
The purpose of a DBMS is to provide an interface for managing, storing, and retrieving data efficiently and securely. It ensures:

    Data organization and accessibility.
    Multi-user environment with data integrity.
    Enforcement of data security.
    Transaction management and recovery.
